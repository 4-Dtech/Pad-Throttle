+ You can now rotate inputs. Used to compensate for the fact that if you move your thumb left on an XBOX controller, you get more like up left.

+ You can now specify a button to switch between relative and absolute throttle mode.

In absolute, push full up, click toggle button, then release stick to set hands-free full speed.
